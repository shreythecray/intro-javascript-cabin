## Week 1 Step 3

### Description:
Learning about Node.JS

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details>
  <summary>
  	1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!
  </summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.
  </summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.
  </summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.
  </summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### What is Node?

Since JavaScript is used in web development, we often need to have an HTML and CSS

Wouldn't it be great to be able to write and test JavaScript without having to build structure and style first? **Node.js** is an open source runtime environment that will allow us to run our code *outside of a web browser* (i.e. no need for HTML, CSS to run the code).
