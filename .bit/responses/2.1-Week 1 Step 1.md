## Week 2 Step 1

### Description:
Introducing APIs

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details><summary>1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details><summary>2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.</summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details><summary>3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.</summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details><summary>4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### What are APIs?

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) essentially allow computers to communicate.m An API is referred to as a **software intermediary** and it provides a channel for various applications to "talk" to each other, without needed direct access to each other's code/implementation.

You could compare APIs to telephones in the real world, where two people (applications) can provide **messages** **to** and get **responses** **from** each other without being in the same room.

### What APIs are we using?

- Twitter API: interact with tweets
- Azure Text API: sentiment/emotion analysis on text
- Azure Face API: sentiment/emotion analysis on images of human faces
- Twilio SMS API: automate sending text messages

### âœ… Review & Submit:

1. Think about about an API (or multiple) that you have seen before and what this API was used for. If you haven't come across any, feel free to research and find one that interests you. Create a flow chart that explains how this API works and add this to your notes.md file under Week 2 Step 1
2. Make a PR with the changes you just made to the repo to continue
