## Week 2 Step 5

### Description:
Going full circle: integrating async functions

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details><summary>1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details><summary>2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.</summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details><summary>3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.</summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details><summary>4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### Going Async

Pulling in Tweets will take time. In order to be to able run the code timely without allowing other functions to overtake this one, we will need to implement an async function that will wait for our getTweets() to complete executing.

Async functions allow other operations to continue running as they are being executed (read more). Promises are sychnronous objects, similar to their real life meaning, return a value at some point in the future, or a reason for why that value could not be returned - they represent the result of an async function that may or may not be resolved.

Recall how we returned a Promise in week 1?

After that we want to create the asynchronous function called waitForTweets(). The way that we can do this is by using the `await` keyword which will force waitForTweets() to wait for getTweets() to complete. Since a promise *returns* a value, we will need to assign the returning value to a variable.

1. Make the getTweets() function return a Promise
2. Create a new asynchronous function called waitForTweets()
3. Await for the return value of getTweets() in waitForTweets()
4. We will also need to use the result in some way, so for now print the result to the console and we're done!
5. Run your code to see what happens.

Don't move forwards until you have printed the result of the getTweets function in waitForTweets().

<details><summary>Peep my code for the getTweets() function:</summary>

  function getTweets() {
    T.get('search/tweets', { q: '#btsarmy since:2021-01-31', count: 10 , language: 'en'}, function(err, data, response) {
      console.log(data)
    })

    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve('resolved');
        }, 2000);
    });
  }
</details>

<details><summary>Peep my code for the waitForTweets() function:</summary>

    async function waitForTweets() {
        const result = await getTweets();
        console.log(result);
    }
</details>
