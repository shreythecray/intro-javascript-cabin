## Week 2 Step 2

### Description:
Understanding packages and getting started with the Twitter API

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details><summary>1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details><summary>2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.</summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details><summary>3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.</summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details><summary>4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### Packages

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) is an **open source developer tool üî®** that allows developers to build JavaScript publicly available code, also known as, **packages**. We will be using npm to get access to:

- Lowdb: package for small databases ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb))
- Twit: Twitter API client for node ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit))
- Twilio

Before starting, we want to download the Twit npm package, which is a "Twitter API client for node", that will give us access to the Twitter API. Open your terminal in VS Code and run the following command. Look at the infographic below to understand how the client-server model works.

1. Install the npm twit package in terminal
2. Create a new file called `homework/app.js`
3. To use the twit package, import it in your app.js file
    * If you run across any errors, feel free to troubleshoot on Google or check the documentation linked above

Don't move onwards until you have imported the twit package and saved your file.
