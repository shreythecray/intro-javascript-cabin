## Week 1 Step 5

### Description:
Understanding packages and getting started with the Twitter API

### Git:

Run the following commands before starting:
1. In your main branch: `git pull` to pull any updates.
2. Delete your previous branches locally `git branch -d [previousBranchName]`, and remotely `git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]`
3. Change your branch to a new one for this step: `git checkout -b w1s5`
4. `git pull` again just in case.

### Let's Get Started

### Packages

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) is an **open source developer tool ðŸ”¨** that allows developers to build JavaScript publicly available code, also known as, **packages**. We will be using npm to get access to:

- Lowdb: package for small databases ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb))
- Twit: Twitter API client for node ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit))
- Twilio

**[Read More about npm â€”>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/)**

Don't have node installed? **[Read more about how you can install Node.js and npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)**

Before starting, we want to download a the Twit required for this app. Open your terminal in VS Code and run the following command.

If you run across any errors, feel free to troubleshoot on Google.

```
npm install twit
```

Now we need to get access to the Twit package. In your local repo (the one that you just made), create a file within the folder called `app.js` add the following code to your `app.js` file:

```
var Twit = require('twit')
```

### Review:

**Open your notes.md file** and describe in your own words what the `npm install` command allows us to do and what your app.js file can do at this moment. Make a PR with your updated notes.md file as well as your new app.js file.
