## Week 2 Step 3

### Description:
Saving and protecting private keys in hidden files

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details><summary>1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details><summary>2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.</summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details><summary>3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.</summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details><summary>4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>


### Setting Up Our APIs

### Create a .env file for your private keys

In this file you want to save and and all of your current and future private variables such as your Azure and Twitter keys.

How to write keys into the .env file:

```
key_name=random-key3458435348534
key2=random-keysdkfdjfgjdfhjfdkhfdjh
```

In your app.js file, add the follow code at the top to allow this program to have access to the keys:

```
require('dotenv').config();
```

### Create a .gitignore file to protect your keys

The .gitignore will prevent files from being pushed into git when you commit your code. Add the following lines:

```
.DS_Store
/node_modules
.env
package-lock.json
```

Note: you only need to add .DS_Store if you are using a Mac computer.

### Setting up the Twitter API with Twit

Let's start with creating our Individual Developer Account on Twitter, which will allow us to get access to the Twitter API. First, log into twitter on the computer and navigate to the¬†[developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/application/use-case)¬†website. Once logged in, it will ask us some questions to guide us through the process of setting up the account. If you're not sure which option to select, choose "Exploring the API" under the "Hobbyist" column and click "Next."

![Twitter Developer Portal](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eP8psz7Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j6i39borl1ou8g82s4ax.png)

We will need to make sure we have a valid phone number and email address associated with the account. Once you are done answering questions to verify your identify, you can submit the form and it will ask you for a unique application name - you can call it anything. In this case, I will name mine¬†`BTweetS`.

Once we're on your Overview page, we can click on the Keys and Tokens button to get access to our API keys.

### üîë Save your Keys 
1. Google how to save keys in a .env file
2. Save your keys into your .env file
3. Google how to access environment variables in JavaScript
4. In your app.js, create a function that prints all of your keys by accessing them through the .env file (you will need to import and use the dotenv npm package)

Don't move until you have saved all of your keys in the .env file and are able to successfully print them.

### ‚úÖ Review & Submit:

1. Under Step 3 in your notes.md file answer the following questions:
    * why do we have a separate file for the keys?
    * what does the .gitignore file do?
    * what do the keys from the Twitter developer portal allow you to do?
2. Make a PR with the changes you just made to the repo to continue
