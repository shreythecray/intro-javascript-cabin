## Week 1 Step 2

### Description:
Learning about JavaScript and distinguishing between different types of functions

### Git:

First time connecting with GitHub from your computer? Check out this website on [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details>
  <summary>
  	1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!
  </summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.
  </summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.
  </summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.
  </summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement dynamic functions into webpages, often used with HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS deal with structure and styling, JavaScript allows webpages to handle managing more complex code and updating images, videos, animations, etc.

Let's look into all the things that make JavaScript stand out from other programming languages and determine what it can be used for.

### What is Node?

Wouldn't it be great to be able to write and test JavaScript without having to build structure and style first? **Node.js** is an open source runtime environment that will allow us to run our code *outside of a web browser* (i.e. no need for HTML, CSS to run the code).

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Functions

Javascript is what we call a "synchronous" language, meaning operations in Javascript block other operations from executing until they are complete, creating a sense of single directional flow. This means that only one operation can happen at a time.

But what happens when a part of your code has to wait for another part? Let's say one of your functions is writing code to a database, and the next function needs something from that database. Since writing to a database can take time, if both functions are synchronous it is very possible that your second function will try to access data before the first function was able to complete executing.

In order to maximize efficiency (save time and resources), Javascript allows the use of asynchronous functions.

Looking at the infographic below, can you guess what this means?

![Sync vs Async (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28051494/109278268-31a79780-77cd-11eb-927f-796a83eca9b1.png)

Simply put, async functions allow other operations to continue running as they are being executed - they can **wait** for something to be completed before they run a piece of code. Promises are sychnronous objects, similar to their real life meaning, return a value at some point in the future, or a reason for why that value could not be returned - they represent the result of an async function that may or may not be resolved.

* [Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous? What the Hell is a Promise?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

* [Master the JavaScript Interview: What is a Promise?](https://medium.com/better-programming/is-javascript-synchronous-or-asynchronous-what-the-hell-is-a-promise-7aa9dd8f3bfb)

In order to let your program know that a function is async, all you have to do it add the keyword `async` at the beginning of your function definition:

<details>
  <summary>Expand to see how to make an async function:</summary>

	function synchronous_function() {
		// ....contents....
	}

	async function asynchronous_function() {
		// ....contents....
	}
</details>

We will elaborate on how to make the async function wait in the next step. These definitions are only to let the program know that the function `asynchronous_function` is not synchronous.

### To Do:

1. **Open the notes.md file**
2. In notes.md, describe what the difference between asynchronous and synchronous functions is in your own words
3. In notes.md, describe examples of when you would use each type of function
4. Make a pull request (PR) to close this issue and continue.
