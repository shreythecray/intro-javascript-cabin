	git pull
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.
  </summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  	3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.
  </summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details>
  <summary>

  </summary>
	
	git pull
</details>
