## Week 1 Step 2

### Description:
Writing our first javascript function

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details><summary>1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details><summary>2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.</summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details><summary>3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.</summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details><summary>4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### 💛 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement dynamic functions into webpages, often used with HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS deal with structure and styling, JavaScript allows webpages to handle managing more complex code and updating images, videos, animations, etc.

[Read more about JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

In this project, we will be create a JavaScript app that filters through some through tweets and uses sentiment analysis on the tweets to filter through and find only the positive ones #positivevibesonly

Note: since I (the developer of this Camp) am a massive ✨ BTS ✨ fan, I will be building the app tailored to the group and will be dropping a LOT of KPOP gifs along the way. Feel free to edit your code to reflect your own personal interests and style along the way 💜💜💜

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer before proceeding.

### 🌍 Hello, world

It's coding **tradition** for everyone's first program to be Hello, World. We will be creating a javascript function that will be printing hello world to the console. What does this mean? Let's try it!

Create a new file:
1. In the left menu bar that shows all the files in this directory, create a new file called week1/helloworld.js
	* Adding week1/ before the file name will create a new folder and place helloworld.js inside it
	* .js is the extension for javascript files
2. Open the file you just made by double clicking it in the left menu
3. Print "hello, world" to the screen
4. Run the code using the `node helloworld.js` command in terminal

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	console.log("hello world");
</details>

Create a new function:
1. Create a function in the helloworld.js file that prints "hello, world" to the screen
2.  Run the code using the `node helloworld.js` command in terminal

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	function hello() {
		console.log("hello world");
	}

	hello();
</details>

### 👋 Hello, jungkook

Now, let's complicate things a little. Instead of simply printing `hello, world` to the screen, let's create a second function that takes user input from the command line arguments to print the name of the person running the code.


***Example input:***
```
node helloworld.js jungkook
```

***Example output:***
```
hello, jungkook
```

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	function hello_2() {
		var name = process.argv[2];
		console.log("hello, " + name);
	}

	hello_2();
</details>

### 👋👋👋 Hello, hello, hello jungkook

Create a third function that gets the user's name, `name`, and an integer, `n`, from the user in the command line, and prints "hello" `n` times before printing their name.

***Example input:***
```
node helloworld.js jungkook 5
```

***Example output:***
```
hello hello hello hello hello, jungkook
```

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	function hello_3() {
		var name = process.argv[2];
		var n = process.argv[3];
		var hello = "hello ";
		for (var i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
			hello += "hello ";
		console.log(hello + ", " + name);
	}

	hello_3();
</details>

### Goodbye, jungkook

Create a fourth function that prints "hello, [name]" if `n` is an odd number and "bye, [name]" if `n` is an even number.

***Example input:***
```
node helloworld.js jungkook 5
```

***Example output:***
```
hello, jungkook
```

***Example input:***
```
node helloworld.js jungkook 100
```

***Example output:***
```
bye, jungkook
```

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	function hello_4() {
		var name = process.argv[2];
		var n = process.argv[3];
		var greeting;
		if (n%2 == 0)
			greeting = "bye, ";
		else
			greeting = "hello, ";
		console.log(greeting + name);
	}

	hello_4();
</details>

You did it!!
