## Week 1 Step 1

### Description:
Initializing and cloning this git repo

### Git:

Before we start working on anything, we want to make sure to clone this repository so that you can easily edit your work and make pull requests locally.

[Cloning A Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Prepare:
1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your computer
	* We will be using VS Code as our code editor
2. Open a new terminal (top menu > Terminal > New Terminal)

Run the following commands in the terminal:
1. `git init` to initialize the repository
2. `git clone [link-to-repo]` to create a copy of this repo on your device
3. `git branch` to check which branch you're currently in (should say either `main` or `master`)
4. `git checkout -b w1s1` (w1s1 = week 1 step1) to create a new branch (this should automatically move you to the new branch you create)
5. `git checkout w1s1` to change branch to w1s1

**Open the notes.md file.** We will be using the notes.md to document our learnings at each step. At the top of the file you will see a Week 1 heading and Step 1 sub-heading. Under Step 1, explain what git does in 3-5 sentences. When you are done, make a PR with the changes you have made to notes.md to continue.
