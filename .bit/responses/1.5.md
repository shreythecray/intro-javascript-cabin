## Week 1 Step 3

### Description:
Learning about Promises and making async functions wait for synchronous functions

### Git:

Run the following commands before starting:
1. In your main branch: `git pull` to pull any updates.
2. Delete your previous branches locally `git branch -d [previousBranchName]`, and remotely `git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]`
3. Change your branch to a new one for this step: `git checkout -b w1s3`
4. `git pull` again just in case.

### Promises:

Last time, we saw: Promises are sychnronous objects, similar to their real life meaning, return a value at some point in the future, or a reason for why that value could not be returned - they represent the result of an async function that may or may not be resolved.

**What is an object?** Objects are variables that can hold multiple variables. For example:

```
// variable
var btsMember = "Jungkook";

// object
var btsMember = {firstName:"Jungkook", lastName:"Jeon", birthYear:"1997", favoriteColor:"black"};
```

[JavaScript Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp)

How do we use objects?

When we have an existing object and want to create a new copy of it, we can use the `new` keyword:

```
var person = new Object();
```

**How do we wait for a Promise?** We can use the `await` expression inside an async function to pause the async function until a Promise is resolved (fulfilled or rejected).

Usage:

```
return_var_name = await sync_function_name;
```

`sync_function_name` will be the name of the synchronous function we are waiting for and `return_var_name:` will hold the return value of the Promise from `sync_function_name`.

### To Do:

Create a new file called "promise.js". Write a JavaScript program that with the function definitions for an asynchronous function and a synchronous function.

In the synchronous function, **return** a new instance of a Promise.

```
return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve('resolved');
        }, 2000);
    });
```

In the asynchronous function, use the `await` expression to wait for the synchronous to complete. Print the returning value of the synchronous function.

### Review:

**Open the notes.md file** and describe what is happening inside the Promise object, line by line. Make a PR with the updated notes.md and new promise.js files to continue.
